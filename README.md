Based on "How To Create a Pure CSS Dropdown Menu" form Chris Spooner.<br />
URL: http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pure-css-dropdown-menu

I changed the base dropdown menu from pure css to <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>.

<strong>HOW TO USE?</strong><br />
You can see a style.scss/style.css, just delete from the index.html, or write whate you want to.
